ReadMe API v2 is the best way to programmatically access your ReadMe data once you have migrated to [ReadMe Refactored](docs:welcome-to-readme-refactored). We’re giving you access to the very same API that ReadMe’s developers use to build ReadMe. Let’s try it out.

> 🚧 ReadMe’s API v2 is currently in beta.
>
> This API and its docs are a work in progress. While we don’t expect any major breaking changes, you may encounter occasional issues as we work toward a stable release. Make sure to [check out our API migration guide](https://docs.readme.com/main/reference/api-migration-guide), and [feel free to reach out](mailto:support@readme.io) if you have any questions or feedback!

## 💡 Make your first API v2 Request

We’re going to use cURL in this example, however any HTTP client should work too. Let’s start with a request to get details about your project.

```sh
curl -X GET https://api.readme.com/v2/projects/me --header "Authorization: Bearer {your-api-key}"
```

In the `Authorization` header you’ll need to add an API key. Learn more about ReadMe API keys [here](https://docs.readme.com/main/reference/intro/authentication).

When you run this cURL command, you will see JSON with details about your project. If that’s the case, you’ve successfully made your first API v2 request. If not, [contact support](mailto:support@readme.io?subject=I+need+help+making+an+API+request) and we’ll help you figure it out!

Most aspects of this cURL command can be reused for your other API requests; here are the most important points:

* [https://api.readme.com/v2/](https://api.readme.com/v2/) is the hostname for every API call. You can place it into a constant for reuse across all of your API requests.
* [The `Authorization` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization) will always be how you provide your API key. The value must include the string `Bearer`, then a space, then your API key.
* The `GET` HTTP method return data, but will never change data.
* The `POST` HTTP method requests generally create data (such as guides or custom pages), but is also used for more complex requests like search.
* The `PATCH` HTTP method is used for editing data that already exists.
* The `PUT` HTTP method is used for creating data (if you have the URI) or replacing data that already exists.
* The `DELETE` HTTP method is used for deleting data that already exists.

## ‼️ Major changes

### Authentication

**As mentioned previously, authentication has changed:**

ReadMe API v1 previously used [Basic Authentication](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617) and has now moved to [Bearer Authentication](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750). Here’s what a cURL request looked like previously in API v1:

```sh
curl -X GET https://dash.readme.com/api/v1 --user "{your-api-key}:"
```

That same request with API v2:

```sh
curl -X GET https://api.readme.com/v2/projects/me --header "Authorization: Bearer {your-api-key}"
```

### Hostname

**As mentioned previously, the hostname has changed:**

* API v1 (old): [https://dash.readme.com/api/v1](https://dash.readme.com/api/v1)
* API v2 (new): [https://api.readme.com/v2](https://api.readme.com/v2)

### Versions

Across API v2, we have reworked our API URIs from being centered around "versions" to "branches" as part of our support for [branching](docs:branches) within [ReadMe Refactored](docs:welcome-to-readme-refactored). **All branching APIs we offer within API v2 support both versions and feature branches.**

Though the recommended API v2 URIs use `/branches/{branch}`, we still do support accessing these endpoints via `/versions/{version}` or `/versions/{branch}` for backwards compatibility reasons. If you use the latter, we emit a [Warning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Warning) header with a `199` code informing you that they have been deprecated.

#### Specifying Project Version

**The project version has moved from a`x-readme-version` header into the URL:**

* As with API v1, you can pass the version with or without the `v` prefix (e.g., `GET https://api.readme.com/v2/branches/1.0/custom_pages` or `GET https://api.readme.com/v2/branches/v1.0/custom_pages`).
* Previously, if you wanted the default version (a.k.a. stable version) you could leave the header out. With the new API, you can use the word `stable` (e.g., `GET https://api.readme.com/v2/branches/stable/custom_pages`).

### Flag Values

Nearly all flags that were previously dilineated with boolean values (e.g., `true` or `false`) have now been moved to enum fields (e.g., `enabled` or `disabled`). The API reference docs for a given endpoint and the fields within will contain detailed information on what the possible enum values are.

The reason for this change is that we previously ran into issues for instances where we needed to introduce an additional state beyond true and false. Enums provide us with additional overhead for future enhancements and more descriptive states (e.g., `enabled` vs. `disabled`, `public` vs. `anyone_with_link`, etc.), while maintaining a nearly identical API reference experience.

### Resource Identifiers

**Resources are identified via URIs and slugs**:

We’ve heard your feedback that using hexadecimal object IDs (e.g., `5f92cbf10cf217478ba93561`) in API v1 to identify resources (e.g., API definitions, categories, etc.) make it difficult to build scalable integrations (e.g., integrations that might update many API definitions at once across several project versions) so we have migrated to using slugs and URIs as our primary resource identifiers.

For example, to retrieve all of the API schemas for a given project version, you’d make a request to `GET /v2/branches/{branch}/apis` and your response may look something like this:

```json
{
  "total": 1,
  "data": [
    {
      ...
      "created_at": "2025-01-27T16:33:27.193Z",
      "type": "openapi",
      "upload": {
        "status": "done"
      },
      "uri": "/branches/1.0/apis/petstore.json",
    }
  ]
}
```

For this API definition resource the URI is `/branches/1.0/apis/petstore.json` and the slug is `petstore.json`. You can use the URI and slug for this API definition to make reads and writes to that resource. For example, you can make the following API request to retrieve information about your `petstore.json` API definition:

```sh
curl -X GET https://api.readme.com/v2/branches/1.0/apis/petstore.json --header "Authorization: Bearer {your-api-key}"
```

### Response Body Shapes

**The response body shape has changed:**

We now offer consistent snake\_case field names and have structured the responses in anticipation of growing them to include more useful data over time by nesting all objects within a top-level `data` property. If you are retrieving a collection of results, `data` will be an array of objects. If you are retrieving a single resource, `data` will be an object.

Here’s what a response from our [custom pages API](docs:custom-page) formerly looked like with API v1:

```json
[
  {
    "metadata": {
      "image": [],
      "title": "",
      "description": "",
      "keywords": ""
    },
    "mdx": {
      "altBody": "",
      "status": "rdmd"
    },
    "algolia": {
      "recordCount": 1,
      "publishPending": false
    },
    "title": "Welcome to the API",
    "slug": "welcome-to-the-api",
    "body": "We’ve got endpoints galore",
    "html": "",
    "htmlmode": false,
    "fullscreen": false,
    "hidden": true,
    "revision": 2,
    "_id": "673974422297a9aa6fc28b2b",
    "createdAt": "2025-01-16T21:12:34.267Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-01-16T21:12:34.267Z",
    "lastUpdatedHash": "1608f5b78bac84444acc76ce134667c318bbc6ee",
    "__v": 0
  }
]
```

That same request under API v2:

```json
{
  "total": 1,
  "data": [
    {
      "appearance": {
        "fullscreen": false
      },
      "content": {
        "body": "We’ve got endpoints galore",
        "type": "markdown"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "description": null,
        "image": {
          "uri": null,
          "url": null
        },
        "keywords": null,
        "title": null
      },
      "privacy": {
        "view": "public"
      },
      "slug": "welcome-to-the-api",
      "title": "Welcome to the API",
      "updated_at": "2025-01-16T21:15:53.484Z",
      "links": {
        "project": "/projects/me"
      },
      "uri": "/branches/1.0/custom_pages/welcome-to-the-api"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Pagination

**Pagination has changed:**

In API v2 we no longer use the [`Link` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Link) that [we used in API v1](refs:pagination). In API v2 we have a new "Collection" format that includes pagination metadata alongside the data you requested. Here’s an example:

```json
{
  "total": 5,
  "page": 2,
  "per_page": 2,
  "paging": {
    "next": "/images?page=3&per_page=2",
    "previous": "/images?page=1&per_page=2",
    "first": "/images?page=1&per_page=2",
    "last": "/images?page=3&per_page=2"
  },
  "data": [
    {
      /* image object */
    },
    {
      /* image object */
    }
  ]
}
```

`total`, `page` and `per_page` (previously `perPage`) behave like they did in API v1, giving you all the important quantity-related metadata. `paging` is where it gets interesting. This object contains four URIs that are the API calls you can make to get additional pages of content:

* `next` is the page of content immediately following the current page. If the current page is the last page, this will be `null`.
* `previous` is the page of content immediately before the current page. If the current page is the first page, this will be `null`.
* `first` is the very first page of content. This will always have a value.
* `last` is the very last page of content. This will always have a value.

**Note:** These pagination links will retain the query parameters used in your API call. In fact you shouldn’t need to modify the pagination URLs in any way!

## 🆕 API Endpoint and Response changes

While the URLs for every API endpoint have changed, we worked to make them intuitive to use. Let’s walk through an example below.

Here’s a comparison of the old and new endpoints to get a list of all of your custom pages:

**API v1:**

```
GET https://dash.readme.com/api/v1/custompages
```

**API v2:**

```
GET https://api.readme.com/v2/branches/{branch}/custom_pages
```

#### Changes to how we process API definition uploads

In order to better support larger and more complex API definitions, we have moved API definition upload processing into a queue-based system. What this means for you is that now when you upload a new API definition with `POST /branches/{branch}/apis` or update an existing with `PUT /branches/{branch}/apis/{filename}`, your upload will not be immediately processed.

Instead, we now surface an `upload.status` property on the response of these APIs to inform you where in our processing pipeline your API is. You can poll this field via `GET /branches/{branch}/apis/{filename}`, which our `POST` and `PUT` endpoints conveniently return for you in a `uri` property. The possible values of `upload.status` are the following:

* `pending`
* `failed`
* `done`
* `pending_update`
* `failed_update`

If you ever receive `failed` or `failed_update` it means that there was a processing the API, usually the result of an OpenAPI validation error, and you can see the reason for the failure in `upload.reason`. When you receive `done`, however, your API has finished processing and any new or changed API reference pages from it are immediately available on your ReadMe project!

When creating an API, you can specify the filename within the `multipart/form-data` payload.<br /><br />In response payloads, the `uri` will contain the unique resource identifier.                                                                                                                |
| `source`  | `source.current`<br />`source.original` | Our `source` object now informs you of the current, and original, source from which this API was ingested. `source.original` will is immutable from the first upload but `source.current` may change from subsequent uploads if you use alternative upload methods.<br /><br />These values remain largely unchanged except for `cli` mapping to `rdme` and `cli-gh` mapping to `rdme_github`.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `type`    | `type`                                  | In addition to our previously supported `openapi` and `swagger` values, dictating the type of API this is, we have added support for `postman`. Though we convert Postman API schemas to OpenAPI on ingestion, this will be set to `postman` if that conversion took place.<br /><br />We have also added a new `unknown` type for when an invalid API definition is uploaded. See [our above documentation](#changes-to-how-we-process-api-definition-uploads) for the changes we’ve made to the API definition upload flow for more information. |
| `version` | *(moved to path parameter)*             | Because our API URIs are now centered around supplying a version or branch directly in the API URI via a path parameter, we have dropped support for this value in the request/response body because this value would be identical to what you supplied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

If you do not see a piece of data listed here then we no longer support it in API v2. Are we missing something you relied on? [Give us a shout!](mailto:support@readme.io)

| `order`   | `position`                  | We do not currently return `position` in category responses. However if you know the position you wish to set a category at in your sidebar, you can supply `position` to either the POST or PATCH endpoints.                                            |
| `id`      | `title`                     | We have dropped support for our legacy hexidecimal IDs in favor of the unique resource identifier of a `title`.                                                                                                                                          |
| `project` | `links.project`             | This was previously a hexidecimal ID to the project attached to the page. We have replaced this with a `links.project` URI to our [`GET /projects/me`](refs:getproject) endpoint where you can obtain additional information.                            |
| `slug`    | `title`                     | Previously there was no difference in API v1 between `slug` and `title` so we have dropped `slug` in favor of the latter.                                                                                                                                |

| `type`    | `section`                   | This has been removed in favor of supplying a `section` path parameter to the category APIs.                                                                                                                                                             |

| `body`                 | `content.body`          | We previously had this data split across two different properties of `body` and `html`. If `body` has content and `html` is empty then your custom page is pure Markdown. If it had `html` but no `body` then it was an HTML custom page. We have merged these two into a single `content.body` property and given you a discriminator of `content.type` that you can use to infer the type of content this is.                                          |
| `hidden`               | `privacy.view`          | If `privacy.view` is `anyone_with_link` then the page is hidden.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `htmlmode`             | `content.type`          | If `htmlmode` was previously `true`, then `content.type` is `html`. The default `type` is `markdown`, meaning your custom page is pure Markdown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `metadata.image`       | `metadata.image`        | This previously returned an array of various pieces of your image, like the URL and colors that are used in it. For the image URL you can now access this via `metadata.image.url`. For the additional metadata that was originally part of this array, you can now access that data by making a request to the [`GET /image/{identifier}`](refs:getimage) endpoint — the URI of which is available through the `metadata.image.uri` response parameter. |
| `metadata.keywords`    | `metadata.keywords`     | This was previously a comma-separated list, it is now an array of strings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Docs

Previously because all of our guide and API reference APIs had a resource identifier of a hexidecimal ID with a single endpoint to handle both page types. This has changed with APIv2 where we have reshaped their responses, not only because guides and reference have independent sets of identifiers, but also to allow for future expansion (e.g., potentially returning the referenced OpenAPI defintion when retrieving an API reference).

Functionally these two APIs are identical, and the `/reference/` family of endpoints includes some additional data.

<small>† Though we have differing APIs for guides and API reference pages, our `GET /search` endpoint handles all forms of content in your ReadMe Project: guides, references, recipes, discussions, etc.</small>

### Version

As mentioned above, our version APIs have been reframed around the [branching](docs:branches) functionality now available within [ReadMe Refactored](docs:welcome-to-readme-refactored). Versions and branches off of those versions are accessed through the same API, just supply the name of that version (e.g., `2.0`) or the branch (e.g., `2.0_cool-dogs`) within the endpoint URI. You can key off of the `type` property, `version` or `branch`, from the response to know what kind of data you have.
